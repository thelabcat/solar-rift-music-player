# Solar Rift Area Music Player

This little program plays the adaptive music from the Flash game [Solar Rift](https://armorgames.com/play/13120/solar-rift), with a slider that lets you choose the danger level to emulate. The code itself is under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). The included music is owned by its creator, [Zach Striefel](https://www.zachstriefel.com/), distributed with his permission.

You can listen to pre-mixed versions of the music with steadily increasing danger levels [here](https://rumble.com/playlists/HUIhonMpgFM), along with the main menu music, which is not adaptive.

Enjoy!
